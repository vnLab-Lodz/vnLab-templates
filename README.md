## What is PaaW?

PaaW is short for **Publication-as-a-Website**, a concept drafted at vnLab in search of alternaitives to very restricting ebook formats. It is a way of thinking about online publications in a web-first manner, which fully utilizes the possibilities offered by the modern-day web, while avoiding the pitfalls of building platforms.

### Core concepts

A PaaW project aims to fulfil at least a subset of the following assumptions:

1. Compliant with existing standards.
2. Free of limitations on design, multimedia or interactive side.
3. Supporting scientific instruments like footnotes, bibliographies and annotations.
4. Supporting search and/or indexing.
5. Compliant with PWA standard.
6. Versionable.
7. Visible in Google Scholar.
8. Distinguishable with ORCID idenitifier.

### How it works?

At its core PaaW project is a Gatsby site that has been configured to comply with the standard predefined above. It supports rendering of markdown (MDX) files as pages, from which the publication takes shape. With the support of MDX the content of the publication can be enchanced by multitude of visual components like images, videos, audio, 3D renders and whatever else a publication could need.
